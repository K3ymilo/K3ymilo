I'm Kamil. No one really knows me well. I started my adventure with plugins in 2015. I tried to learn on the fly how to write plugins, but there are important and more important things. In my spare time I write plugins for EasyHC and Survival servers.

- 📖 Currently, I am still trying to increase my skills in java.
- 🛠️ I am currently creating a server [TwoCastle](https://twocastle.pl/).
